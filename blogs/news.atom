      <![CDATA[<p>The antioxidants in Hemp Seed Oil reduces free radicals in your body and slows down the aging process. Regular use of hemp-based skincare and beauty products can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in your face and body.</p>
<p>Hair and skin are all formed from the same line of cells; so, you will be pleasantly surprised that when you use Hemp Seed Oil, thicker and shinier hair, and softer skin will result. Since Hemp Seed Oil is nearly identical to the building blocks of our own living cells, it penetrates your cells and lubricates the surfaces between them. It is used to nourish not only dry skin but blotches and lesions as well. It can also detoxify your skin and even out skin tone.</p>
<p>Hair care products containing Hemp Seed Oil are ideal for those who are suffering from hair loss. Hemp Seed Oil’s Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid content can stimulate your hair growth. 90% of your hair is made up of a protein known as keratin, which Hemp Seed Oil can supplement to boost your healthy hair growth. In addition, Hemp Seed Oil also improves blood circulation in your scalp so that follicles remain nourished to support new hair growth. Moreover, Hemp Seed Oil also acts as a good natural moisturizer and can dramatically reduce visible signs of dry skin while providing nourishment from the inside out.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Did you hear about some of the wonderful benefits of <strong>Sunflower Seed Oil</strong> (and more specifically Vitamin E) for your skin? This oil is an excellent source of Vitamin E. One tablespoon of this oil contains 6.1 milligrams of Vitamin E. Ok, check these skin care benefits out: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Moisturizing:</strong> Vitamin E acts as an emollient that traps moisture inside your skin cells. Therefore, using Sunflower Seed Oil for your skin helps keep it hydrated for a longer period.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anti-aging activity:</strong> Vitamin E is a strong antioxidant that mitigates the damage done by free radicals to your skin. There is also clinical proof that Vitamin E in skin care products may help protect the collagen and elastin in your skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Using Sunflower Seed Oil for your skin only several times per week can help postpone its aging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activity:</strong> Vitamin E helps lower skin redness and roughness.</li>
<li>
<strong>Skin protection:</strong> Vitamin E maintains your outer protective skin layer. The topical use of Sunflower Seed Oil on your skin helps shield it from future environmental damage and limit moisture loss.</li>
