These minerals promote blood circulation, relaxing your nerves. Cellulite is the fat that causes a cottage-cheese like appearance on your body. Fat and body fluids become trapped in skin tissues near the surface of your skin. Massaging dead sea mud on the areas with cellulite stimulates the blood circulation and cleanses toxins out through your pores. This helps flatten out the cottage-cheese bumps that are caused by cellulite.\u003c\/p\u003e","products":[{"product_id":"taza-dead-sea-mineral-mud-natural-soap","title":"Taza Dead Sea Mineral Mud Natural Soap (Pack of 3)","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\" size=\"6\"\u003e*Free Standard Shipping\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/em\u003e; \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\" size=\"6\"\u003e*Orders from this site Fulfillment by Amazon.ca;\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/em\u003e \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\" size=\"6\"\u003e*Secure \u0026amp; Protected Cardholder Data Processing with Shopify Payments\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/em\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTaza Dead Sea Mineral Mud Natural Soap \u003c\/b\u003e provides mild cleansing and keeps your skin soft, radiant, glowing, and healthy.
