<p><b>Taza Tri-Peptide Serum</b> includes a phytosteroid complex of Wild Yam and Soya for even more firming and wrinkle reduction. This serum also contains Guarana, a plant from Brazil, that contains xanthine alkaloids (theophylline, caffeine, theobromine), recognized to tone, stimulate blood vessels and eliminate excess fatty tissue, making this serum especially good for under the eyes and for the neck as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>98% Natural • No Parabens • No Phthalates • No Sulphates • Suitable for all skin types including the most sensitive</li>
<li>Contains Guaraná (a shrub native to the Brazilian Amazon) whcih helps reduce puffiness around the eyes and excess fat under the chin and neck areas</li>
<li>Contains Wild Yams which acts as a natural peptide. It is also a powerful anti-inflammatory that helps speed tissue regeneration resulting in normalization of damaged skin</li>
<li>Contains Acqua Biomin, which are ocean minerals containing high concentrations of selenium, magnesium, copper, zinc, calcium, and germanium. These ocean minerals are also found in the skin and over time are depleated through daily environmental exposure. Through application of this ingredient these necessary minerals are replaced in the skin</li>
<li>Contains Soy Extract which includes soy isoflavones that are the most potent of the antioxidant phytoestrogens; this extract supports elasticity and firmness in the skin, helping keep skin soft and flexible as is needed when rebuilding damaged collagen</li>
</ul>
<p>We suggest that you use the Taza Natural Seaplex Anti-Aging Facial Cream over this serum to enhance the anti-aging and firming effects on your skin. Also adding Taza Natural Eye &amp; Neck Cream with these products will enhance the anti aging effects around the eyes, as it combines extracts like Haloxyl, Matrixyl 3000 and Guarana to combat dark circles, under eye bags, and puffiness.</p>

<p><b>Taza Natural Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum</b> is a 100% natural multifunctional serum which performs as an exfoliant, anti-oxidant, and skin agent with anti-aging properties. This is an intensive Vitamin C facial product that helps to moisturize and diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This product contains: Ethyl Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Hyaluronic Acid (HA), Fruit Acids (Alpha Hydroxy Acid). The following are benefits of these ingredients:</p>

<li>The Niacinamide (Vitamin B3): Improves skin's elasticity with anti-wrinkle properties • Enhances barrier function preventing skin from losing water content • Helps discoloration and uneven skin tone • Stimulates microcirculation in the dermis.</li>
